## Object Creational Patterns

#### Goals

1. Research stacks & queues and their corresponding public APIs. Before starting, double check with us that you have a good understanding of their public methods.

2. Write code for a stack and a queue using each of the 4 different object creational patterns (functional, functional-shared, prototypal & pseudo-classical).

3. Be sure to test your functions as you go.

4. You will end up with eight source files and eight test files. One stack and one queue for each Object pattern.

It's very important that after you finish each exercise you try not to reference the code (whether source or test) of the previous one. Attack it afresh if you can. You must not use JavaScript Arrays, Object only.

### Extra credit

At first glance, it might appear that each spec needs only minor changes. Extra credit if you write tests that confirm that the implementation actually implements the relevant object creational pattern.

This will require some serious thought about what commonalities there are between each of the patterns (e.g. which declare variables? Which reuse methods? Which have their own methods?) and how you would test such commonalities.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the different ways that you can create objects in JavaScript, together with their pros and cons.
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
